## Introduction
This workshop is split into two parts. In the first part you will use automated machine learning in Azure to create, deploy and understand a classification model using the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. In the second part, you will take a previous built model and further tune the hyper parameters.

This process accepts training data and configurations settings, and automatically iterates through combinations of different feature normalization/standardization methods, models, and hyperparameter settings to arrive at the best model.

## HyperDrive

1. In JupyterLabs, click through the following path **<your-alias>/samples/python/1.0.74/how-to-use-azureml/ml-frameworks/scikit-learn/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-sklearn** and open the **train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-sklearn.ipynb** file.

1. You can now run the notebook either by clicking the **play** icon in the top bar or by using **Shift+Enter** in the code cells of the notebook.

> In the third cell of your notebook, set `cluster_name` = `aml-compute`

1. The Jupyter notebook contains step by-step guidance on configuration, training and exploration of a machine learning model.
